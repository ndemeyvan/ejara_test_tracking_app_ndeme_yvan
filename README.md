## This is the test project of Ejara tracking plan made by Ndeme Yvan Rodrigue

This project is made up of project screens, navigation and event tracking.

What can we expect? 


As well as tracking via amplitude of all the events present in the specifications(([figma]([https://link-url-here.org](https://doc.clickup.com/20509715/d/h/khx0k-41022/70a4a95231cb160/khx0k-8942))))

## We should not expect :
- Features integrated with a backend
- Full screen implementation logics 

## What can we expect :
- Screen implementation to the ([figma]([https://link-url-here.org](https://www.figma.com/file/6iEORxJMDDBrJ5MIPQ1iq3/Application-Collecte-Cash?type=design&node-id=76-2&t=9DhTKpCsYOMQI2JC-0)))
- navigation between screens correctly ( route name )
- Bloc pattern
- Screen utils implementation
- Amplitude integration
- Clear comments
- Field validation 
- Screen divided into the most important components for greater reusability (buttons, text fields, etc.)
